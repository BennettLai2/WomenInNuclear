 In the future, we want the form label to be a meeting code that we can enter and check.
 For this, we need to create a new entity -> Event
 We have to check if the event written is inside of the Event table. If it is, we
 are able to update the points (also grab the points from the event variable).
 We just have to search for that certain event code. And if we can't find event
 code, we just need to update as zero.

<h4>Current Points: <%= current_user.points %></h4>

<div class="actions">
